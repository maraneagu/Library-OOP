# Library-OOP
 
The third project implemented in the Object Oriented Programming course in my second semester at FMI.

Managing a library: 
- you can see the articles that are in the library's stock;
- you can add cds, magazines and books to the library's stock;
- you can rent and restitute the articles from the library.
